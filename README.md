<h2 style="color: yellow;">A Family Story</h2>
<p>At the beginning, there was one man : Zorro Zapetto. Zorro is the foundator of the Wild Circus. Born in 1932 in Little Italy, in New York, he worked as a builder for about 20 years. Then, one day, he decided to change completely his way of living and to live his dream.<p>
<h2 style="color: yellow">When The Dream Become True</h2>
<p>The Wild Circus was born ! Even if it was hard at the beginning, even if there wasn't food everyday, Zorro persisted again and again. Today, the Wild Circus is the most famous circus in the world ! From Japan to Chili, the Wild Circus don't know any frontier !<br>And today we are sincerely happy to announce you our next show ! Probably the most spectacular, the most incredible and the most mystical of all our shows !</p>
